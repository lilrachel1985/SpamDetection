# SpamDetection
**The main objective of this ungraded lab is to compare performance across labeling options to understand the role that good labeling plays on the performance of Machine Learning models**, these options are:
1. Randomly generated labels (performance lower bound)
2. Automatic generated labels based on three different label strategies
3. True labels (performance upper bound)
The project explores labeling how can be applied to text data.
 The dataset contains comments from the 2015 top 5 most popular Youtube videos. Each comment has been labeled as `spam` or `not_spam` depending on its contents
